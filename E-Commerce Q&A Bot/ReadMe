AI-Powered E-Commerce Q&A Bot!

I just built an interactive chatbot that lets you ask questions directly from any website and get instant, accurate answers—powered by LangChain, RAG, and LLMs.

✅ Features:
✔ Load any e-commerce site
✔ Ask natural questions like “What’s the return policy?”
✔ Context-aware answers using retrieval-augmented generation
✔ Built with Streamlit + Ollama (TinyLlama for local inference)

Excited to explore how this can transform customer support and boost user experience!
